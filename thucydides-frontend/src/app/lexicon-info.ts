export const ABOUT: string = `Welcome to the Lexeis Thucydidean Lexicon! Thucydides uses his vocabulary in a very specific and precise way,
so an author-specific lexicon for his text is a key resource both for students reading his work for the first
time and established scholars doing a deep dive into the text
This project seeks to update the 19th century concept of the author-specific Lexicon for the 21st century,
using the comprehensive data developed by the Perseus Project at Tufts and augmented for Greek
authors by Helma Dik of the University of Chicago. All citations are linked to the text of Thucydides itself
(and the text is linked back to the lexicon). The lexicon includes short definitions specific to Thucydides,
information on word-frequencies (also frequency by speech (direct and indirect), narrative and authorial
contexts), words of the same stem or prefix, and will include not only new definitions in English but also
relevant bibliography, illustrations and other words of the same semantic category.
Pending completion of new definitions for each word (which we envision occupying several years) we
have incorporated the relevant text of the 1843 lexicon by BÃ©tant with Latin translations divided by
categories, which is still regarded as a highly useful tool.`;
